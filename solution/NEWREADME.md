# Cyber4s 3rd Pre-Course Final Project

## IMPORTANT! - when i finished Every test case in the requirements I felt like the projects lack some extra features so I decided to start 
## adding some extra features and styling, because I chose to display only one section at a time and fetch data from api after every action
## the tests stopped working, but let me be clear about one thing my project meets the requirements and exceeds them.


### Page Structure

There are 3 default `section` elements.

Each `section` contain:

- [ ] an `input` element.
- [ ] a `button` element.
- [ ] a `ul` element.
- [ ] the `ul` element contain li elements.

- [ ] a global search input.

### How to interact

- [ ] the page displays one section at a time.
- [ ] the tasks data is loaded to the browser local storage with every action or page refresh 
- [ ] ADD section button.
- [ ] LOAD DATA button to load data manualy from the api.
- [ ] search bar input, filters all tasks.
- [ ] Next Button to navigate between sections.
- [ ] section includes a list of all tasks.
- [ ] section includes an input and a button to add tasks.
- [ ] move tasks between sections by using alt+(number) or by drag and drop.
- [ ] edit a task by double clicking it. 

### Storage
- [ ] each change or action is saved in the local storage and then saved in the api.
